# Smart Home Rain & Weather System

A 2nd-year IoT course project demonstrating a wireless control system using two ESP32 microcontrollers (Sender & Receiver) to manage servo motors and RGB lighting.

## 📋 Project Overview
This system establishes a communication link between a sender unit and a receiver unit to perform remote hardware control tasks.

* **Sender Unit:** Reads environmental data (Temperature, Humidity, Rain) via sensors and transmits it wirelessly.
* **Receiver Unit:** Receives data to control Servo motor angles and RGB LED colors.

## 🛠️ Hardware Stack
* **Microcontrollers:** 2x ESP32 Dev Kits.
* **Actuators:** Servo Motors.
* **Output:** RGB LEDs.
* **Power:** Custom DIY Power Bank Module (18650 Battery).

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `Sender/`: Source code for the transmitting ESP32.
* `Receiver/`: Source code for the receiving ESP32.
